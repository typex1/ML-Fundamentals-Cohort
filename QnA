### Question: Why  high correlation between 2 attributes can sometimes lead to poor model performance?

Answer from PartyRock "ML Guru" app: https://partyrock.aws/u/fspiess/13PxqSoHE/ML-Guru

I'll explain why high correlation between attributes (also called multicollinearity) can lead to poor model performance.

Let me break this down into clear sections:

1. What is Correlation Between Attributes?
- When two or more features/attributes in your dataset are strongly related to each other
- Example: Height and Weight of a person often have positive correlation
- Can be positive (both increase together) or negative (one increases as other decreases)

2. Main Problems Caused by High Correlation:

a) Model Instability
- Makes it difficult for the model to determine which feature is actually important
- Small changes in data can lead to large changes in coefficients
- Example: In linear regression, coefficients become unstable and unreliable

b) Reduced Interpretability
- Hard to determine the true impact of individual features
- Can't tell which feature is actually driving the predictions
- Makes feature importance analysis less reliable

3. Practical Example:
Let's consider a house price prediction model with these features:
- Square footage
- Number of rooms
- Total floor area

If square footage and total floor area are highly correlated:
- Model might assign high importance to one and low to other arbitrarily
- Coefficients might change dramatically with small data changes
- Can't reliably tell which feature actually impacts price more

4. Why It Affects Different Models:

a) Linear Models (most affected):
- Linear/Logistic regression become unstable
- Feature coefficients become unreliable
- Standard errors increase

b) Tree-based Models (less affected):
- Random Forests and Decision Trees can handle correlation better
- They select the most informative feature at each split

5. Solutions:

a) Feature Selection
- Remove one of the highly correlated features
- Keep the one that makes more business sense or has stronger relationship with target

b) Feature Engineering
- Combine correlated features into a single feature
- Create meaningful ratios or differences

c) Dimensionality Reduction
- Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Transforms correlated features into uncorrelated components

6. Real-world Example:
In credit scoring:
- Income and Spending might be highly correlated
- Including both might make the model unstable
- Better to either:
  * Choose one variable
  * Create a ratio (spending/income)
  * Use PCA to combine them

7. How to Detect:
- Correlation matrix
- VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)
- Scatter plots

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific examples?
